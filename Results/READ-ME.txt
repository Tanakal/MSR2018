The 3 files are the files I use to do the reasearch paper.

I collect "FINAL-Result.txt" by running the c# Project with the Process "ChangeTestFailProcess"
(If you do it, you will find the .txt file in the folder "RunUnitTest")

"FINAL-ResultConvertedInARFF.arff" is just a manual conversion of "FINAL-Result.txt" in arff
"FINAL-Analyses with xlstat on excel.xlsx" is the excel file I use to do statistical analyes

The 4 folders are the folders in where the output of the c# project are stocked.
It's only .txt files.
